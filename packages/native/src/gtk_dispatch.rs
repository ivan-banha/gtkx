//! Dispatching operations to the GTK thread.
//!
//! This module provides a cross-thread queue for dispatching operations from
//! the JS thread to the GTK thread.
//!
//! Two paths exist:
//! - Normal: `schedule()` uses `glib::idle_add_once` to let the GLib main loop process callbacks
//! - Re-entrant: `dispatch_pending()` processes queued callbacks synchronously when the GTK
//!   thread is blocked waiting for a JS callback result
